# SpotMicroESP32
My take on a SpotMicro with an optimized design for supportfree 3D-printing utilizing an ESP32-DevKitC.

## Introduction
This is a work-in-progress, with rather loose milestones. For 2020 there were only two goals
- to redesign the original parts, so that they could be printed without any support
- to make a circuitry for all sensors and parts, that possibly would fit and be considere necessary

Both of these will be coming soon, as both goals have progress farther than 90% each. This repository is a representation of my hobby and as such, it will have its own pace. This being said, i am still happy about any questions, collaborations, suggestions, idead, forks and what else comes to your mind.

## Coming soon...
- STLs and FreeCAD-Files
- KiCAD or Fritzing circuit diagrams
- Photos
- other things i forgot
