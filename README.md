# Prologue
I want to thank Deok-yeon Kim (KDY0523) for his beatiful and well thought out design of the SpotMicro, without whom my derivate would not have been possible. You can find his original Design here on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3445283
Him sharing the files with an open licence, made it possible to let it grow a community around it. This is why i want to reference to them as well - the SpotMicroAI Community: https://spotmicroai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

# SpotMicroESP32
My take on a SpotMicro with an optimized design for supportfree 3D-printing utilizing an ESP32-DevKitC.
You can find the 3D-printing parts on Thingiverse as well: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4559827/files

## Introduction
This is a work-in-progress, with rather loose milestones. For 2020 there were only two goals
- to redesign the original parts, so that they could be printed without any support
- to make a circuitry for all sensors and parts, that possibly would fit and be considere necessary

Both of these will be coming soon, as both goals have progress farther than 90% each. This repository is a representation of my hobby and as such, it will have its own pace. This being said, i am still happy about any questions, collaborations, suggestions, idead, forks and what else comes to your mind.
