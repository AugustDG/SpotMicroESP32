# SpotMicroESP32 - Electronics
This section describes the used electronics and the wiring of the circuitry in detail.

## Bill of Material
The SpotMicroESP32 has a rather large BOM, mainly because I wanted to integrate as much usefull parts, for either enabling the robot for specific future tasks or to provide myself with interesting programming tasks as well.

This being said, the following table has one column indicating the parts necessary and one column for the parts which represent additional goals.

| Model 	| Basic 	| Extended 	| Usage 		|Price (per unit)|Price (total)		|
|-----------|----------:|----------:|---------------|----------------|------------------|
| MG996R 	|       12x |       12x | servos        |
| PCA9685 	|	     1x |        1x | servo and LED driver |
