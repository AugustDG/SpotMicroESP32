# Assembly #
This document describes the assembly process for the SpotMicroESP32. There are some prerequisites to make, before you can begin with the assembly of your printed parts and before you can mount your parts into place. Make sure you have the necessary parts from the [3D-printed Partlist](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/parts/SpotMicroESP32_parts_v1_0_0/). You will need at least the screws and nuts from the [Bill of Materials](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/).

## Prerequisites ##
The single most important thing is to test and to calibrate your servos. By calibration i mean to determin the minimum and maximum positions, and what dutycicle results in what actual angle. Don't use any servos, that behave weird in any way, such as: stuttering, grinding noises, clicking noises or which wont turn at least full 180° - you would regret it afterwards and will have to do a lot of disassembling stuff to get it straight. At last it is important, that you position each servo in it's 90° position.
If you wish to use fabric hoses, make sure you use the smallest and thinest possible. There is just not enough space in these parts to use thick ones. Or simply go with the standard servocable, which could look pretty nice, depending on your color theme.

## Lower Leg ##
You need to make two identical lower legs each for both sides - this means, that you need two mirrored pieces for the lower leg and lower leg counterpiece. Its important that you extend the servo cable and if you use fabric hoses, to guide it through.

### Parts ###

| Total Amount | Part |
|--------------|------|
|  4x | MG996R (2x at 0° and 2x at 180°) |
| 16x | Servo rubber dampeners (should be shipped with your servo) |
|  |  |
|  4x | lower leg (2x right-handed, 2x left-handed) |
|  4x | lower leg counterpiece (2x right-handed, 2x left-handed) |
|  4x | ball bearing pin |
|  4x | foot tips |
|  |  |
| 24x | M3 nuts |
| 16x | M3x20 |
|  8x | M3x8 |
|  4x | M2 nuts |
|  4x | M2x8 |

### Lower leg and foot tip ###

Insert 2x M3 nuts into their spaces in the lower leg. Hold the foot tip at position and screw with 2x M3x8 the foot tip into place.

### Lower leg counterpiece and ball bearing pin ###

Insert 1x M2 nut into the small space in the lower leg counterpiece. Screw 1x M2x8 through the ball bearing pin and attach it to the lower leg counterpiece.

### Lower leg counterpiece and ball bearing pin ###

Insert 4x M3 nuts into the small spaces in the lower leg counterpiece. Insert now from above the servo into its pocket in the lower leg counterpiece. Now push both the lower leg counterpiece with the servo and the lower leg with the foot tip together, closing all gaps. Be careful not to loose any M3 nuts and screw both parts together with 4x M3x20 screws.

### Lower leg completed ###

Your assembled lower leg should look like this one. Repeat it once again for the second left lower leg and assemble the two mirrored (right-handed) right lower legs.

## Upper Leg ##
You need to make two identical upper legs each for both sides - this means, that you need two mirrored pieces for the upper leg bottom shell, upper leg top shell, servohorn mount and ball bearing mount.

### Parts ###

** you might use only two M2x8 on each leg to screw the servohorn into place and thus reducing the amount of M2x8 screws and M2 nuts by 2/3 **

| Total Amount | Part |
|--------------|------|
|  4x | MG996R at 90° |
| 16x | Servo rubber dampeners (should be shipped with your servo) |
|  4x | 625zz ball bearings without flange|
|  |  |
|  4x | upper leg top shell (2x right-handed, 2x left-handed) |
|  4x | upper leg bottom shell (2x right-handed, 2x left-handed) |
|  4x | servohorn mount (2x right-handed, 2x left-handed) |
|  4x | ball bearing mount (2x right-handed, 2x left-handed) |
|  |  |
| 32x | M3 nuts |
| 32x | M3x20 |
|  4x | M3x8 |
| 24x | M2 nuts |
| 24x | M2x8 |

### Servohorn mount ###

You need to screw the M2 nuts on the M2x8 first, otherwise it would hinder the mounting of the servohorn. You can't use the bare M2x8 screws without the nuts in this step, because they would stick out from the other side and touch the servo unavoidably, which would result in blocking the servo movement or other damage. Screw the servohorn into place, using the middle hole on each little arm.
